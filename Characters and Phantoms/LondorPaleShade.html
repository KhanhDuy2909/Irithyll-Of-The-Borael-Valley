            <p><em>The Pale Shades of the Sable Church are all undying Hollows, giving rise to much fear and
                    contempt.<br>
                    Their fight is one of neither honor nor exaltation, yielding nothing but withered moans.</em></p>
            <p>Pale Shades, colloquially known as "Harlots of Death", are assassins of the Sable Church of
                Londor. They are undying hollows who perform atrocities in the name of their sect, covering their
                darkly shriveled appearance with a golden sneering mask. The Manikin Claws are their weapon of
                choice.</p>
